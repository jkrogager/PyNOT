									<p>
                                    PyNOT is available via <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyNOT-redux/">PyPI</a> under the name <span style="font-family:'courier new'">PyNOT-redux</span>. The easiest way to install PyNOT is therefore the following:
									</p>
                                    <pre>
<code>python3 -m pip install PyNOT-redux
</code>
                                    </pre>

                                    <p>
                                    If you prefer to install it yourself from the source, you can clone the source code from GitHub and run the installation script:
                                    </p>
                                    <pre>
<code>git clone https://github.com/jkrogager/pynot.git
cd pynot
python3 setup.py install
</code>
                                    </pre>

																		<p class='warning'>
																			NOTE: PyNOT has only been tested for Python 3.7 and 3.8!

									<p>
									As I'm not a professional software developer, and this is a project I run in my spare time, it's very hard for me to stay on top of all the updates to these dependencies. I would therefore really appreciate if you could let me know of any issues you may encounter as you upgrade any of these packages.

									<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

									<p>
									I want to thank my former thesis advisor, Prof. Johan Fynbo for helpful discussions and feedback, and for introducing me to the Nordic Optical Telescope in the first place (back in 2012). I also want to thank Associate Prof. Lise Christensen for extensive testing of the code and for the great suggestions to the UI.
