<p>
	PyNOT is available via <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyNOT-redux/">PyPI</a>
	under the name <span style="font-family:'courier new'">PyNOT-redux</span>.
	The easiest way to install PyNOT is therefore the following:
</p>

<pre><code>python3 -m pip install PyNOT-redux</code></pre>

<p>
If you prefer to install it yourself from the source, you can clone the source code from GitHub
and run the installation script:
</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/jkrogager/pynot.git
cd pynot
python3 setup.py install
</code>
</pre>

<p class='warning'>
	NOTE: PyNOT has not been tested for Python versions newer than 3.11!
</p>

	I want to give a huge shout out to all the developers of these packages.
	Thanks for developing these fantastic tools and for sharing your work!
</p>

<p>
	As I'm not a professional software developer, and this is a project I run in my spare time,
	it's very hard for me to stay on top of all the updates to these dependencies.
	I would therefore really appreciate if you could let me know of any issues you may encounter
	as you upgrade any of these packages.
</p>


<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>
	I want to thank my thesis advisor, Prof. Johan Fynbo for helpful discussions and feedback,
	and for introducing me to the Nordic Optical Telescope in the first place (back in 2012).
	I also want to thank Dr. Lise Christensen for extensive testing of the code and
	for the great suggestions to the UI.
