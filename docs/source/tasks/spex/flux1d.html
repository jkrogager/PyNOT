<p>
  <h2>Flux Calibration</h2>

  Once the instrument response function has been determined for a given dispersive element using <a href="response.html">pynot response</a>,
  the flux calibration can be applied to a 1-dimensional extracted spectrum by running the command <code>pynot flux1d</code>.
  This command requires three arguments:
  <ol>
    <li>
      The 1D extracted spectrum (in FITS table format, must be wavelength-calibrated!)
    </li>
    <li>
      The response function calculated by <a href="response.html">pynot response</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      The desired filename of the output, given by command line option <code>-o</code>
    </li>
  </ol>

  PyNOT verifies that the science spectrum that you want to flux calibrate has been observed with the same instrumental setting.

<h3>Airmass and Exposure Time</h3>
<p>
  The code automatically tries to determine the airmass of the observation from the FITS header. If this is not possible, the command line will
  prompt you for the value of the airmass. After you enter the value and press the <code>RETURN</code> key, the code will continue.
  Similarly, if the code cannot read the exposure time from the FITS header, the command line will ask you for this value, which must be given in seconds.
