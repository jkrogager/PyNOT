  <h1>PyNOT : sflat</h1>
</header>

<p>
	This task will take a series of calibration exposures taken with a continuum lamp. These should use the 
  same spectroscopic setup as your science exposures (same slit and dispersive element).
	The goal of this task is to remove artefacts in the data caused by variations in the detector
  effeciency as well as impurities in the optical path.
  The task <code>sflat</code> performs the following sub-tasks:

	<ul class="subtasklist">
	<li> <a href="#combination"> Image combination</a> </li>
	<li> <a href="#normalization"> Flat field normalization</a> </li>
	<li> <a href="#summary"> Overview of parameters</a> </li>
	</ul>

<h2 id="combination">Combination of spectroscopic flat-field calibrations</h2>

<p>
  The first step of the task <code>pynot sflat</code> is to remove the bias level and overscan regions
  of all the individual spectroscopic flat-field exposures. For this prupose, a combined bias image
  must be provided using the command line option <code>--bias</code>.
  After the bias level has been removed, the different flat-field exposures are combined using 
  a sigma-clipped mean combination by default. The threshold for the sigma-clipping can be controlled
  by the parameter <code>--kappa</code>. You can also chose to perform a median combination by
  setting the parameter <code>--method median</code>. The resulting combined flat-field will be saved
  to a FITS file which by default is named after the slit width and dispersive element. An example
  is shown in Fig. 1:

  The structure visible in the above figure is due to a combination of effects:
  <ol class="subtasklist">
    <li>The two sharp edges indicate the edges of the grism which are blocking part of the CCD;</li>
    <li>
      The spatial variations with two peaks is an artefact of the calibration lamp not illuminating
      the slit evenly;
    </li>
    <li>
      And lastly, the spectral variation (along the vertical axis) is due to the combination
      of the intrinsic spectral shape of the continuum lamp and the instrument throughput.
    </li>
  </ol>

  The easiest way to prepare the list of input files is to filter the 'dataset.pfc' file created by
  <code><a href="../init.html"></a>pynot init</code> using the <code>grep</code> command:
  <br><br>
  <p class="code">
    %] cat dataset.pfc | grep SPEC_FLAT > flat_.list<br>
  </p>
  <br>
  You can further filter on specific setups in the file, such as slit, grism, filter, exposure time etc.

  <p class="warning">
    Make sure only to combine spectral flat fields taken with the same instrumental setup and detector
    characteristics (binning, readout mode, windowing). The code will complain if the image sizes do not match
    but any other checks is left for the user.

  <h2 id="normalization"> Flat field normalization </h2>

  Given the non-uniform illumination of the slit by this calibration unit, we cannot use these exposure
  to perform an illumination correction. For this purpose, the spectroscopic flat-field exposures should
  be obtained using the twilight sky. However, PyNOT does not cover illumination corrections yet.
  <br>
  Instead, we must characterize both the spatial and spectral variations in order to divide them out.
  This is what we refer to as <i>normalization</i> of the flat-field.
  PyNOT does this by determining the spatial profile of the flat-field in each wavelength bin using
  a Savitzky&ndash;Golay filtering algorithm as implemented in <code>scipy</code>. The parameters of
  the filtering can be controlled via the parameters <code>--order</code> and <code>--savgol_window</code>
  from the command line. Before filtering and fitting the spatial profile in individual wavelength bins,
  the image is first median filtered along the spectral axis to decrease the noise. A default of
  5 pixels are median combined. This can be controlled using the parameter <code>--med_window</code>.
  For more information about the parameters, run <code>pynot sflat -h</code> or <a href="#summary">see below</a>.
  <br>
  The code determines the edges of the illuminated part of the
  CCD using a similar filtering algorithm and its first derivative to look for sharp features.
  In Fig. 1, the edges of the illuminated part of the CCD are clearly visible.

  An example of the normalization of the spatial profile is shown below in Fig. 2 below, and a similar diagnostic
  plot is saved to the working directory with a filename starting with 'specflat_1d'.
  The exact filename is given in the log when running the task.

      of the combined and median-filtered spectroscopic flat-field image (top),
      here using the grism #19 and the 1.0 arcsec slit of AlFOSC mounted at the Nordic Optical Telescope.
      The solid red line in the top panel indicates the estimated spatial profile. The bottom panel
      shows the relative residuals caused by impurities and variations in detector sensitivy. This is 
      typically of the order a few percent.

  </figure>

  A continuum image is then constructed per row by using the filtered spatial profile
  in each wavelength bin inside the illuminsted parts of the CCD. Outside the edges of the illuminated
  part, the continuum image is simply set to 1. The normalized flat field image is then obtained
  by dividing the combined spectral flat field by the continuum image. The result is an image
  which only retains artefacts due to the pixel-to-pixel variations of the CCD sensitivy and
  impurities in the optical path (such as irregular slit edges or dust grains in the optical elements).
  An example of the normalized flat field image of the combined spectroscopic flat-field from Fig. 1
  is shown below:
