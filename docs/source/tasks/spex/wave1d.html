  <h1>PyNOT : wave1d</h1>
</header>

<p>
  This task will apply a wavelength solution obtained by the task <a href="identify.html">pynot identify</a>
  to a 1-dimensional spectrum extracted by <a href="extract.html">pynot extract</a> on a science image which
  has not been rectified using a 2D wavelength solution. 
</p>

<p class="note">
  I highly recommend performing a 2D wavelength calibration using the task <a href="wave2d.html">pynot wave2d</a>;
  but in some cases you may want to limit the potential additional correlations introduced by the rectification,
  of the rectification may fail due to issues in the calibration image (over or under-exposed arc lines).
  In these cases, you can extract the spectrum of your object before performing the wavelength calibration.
  However, you should make sure that you extract the arc line spectrum used for the <a href="identify.html"> line identification </a>
  <b> at the same spatial position along the slit </b> as your science spectrum. Otherwise you may introduce
  a systematic shift in your wavelength calibration. You might also introduce a slight wavelength-dependent drift
  as the wavelength solution is not corrected for the curvature and 2D distortions.
</p>


<h2> Applying the wavelength solution from PyNOT identify </h2>

<p>
  The files needed to perform the wavelength calibration are:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Extracted 1D spectrum</b> in a FITS table format. This is the default format from <a href="extract.html">pynot extract</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>The pixel table</b>. This is the output from the line identification step that translates the pixel position along the dispersion axis
      to wavelengths.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3>Controlling the wavelength sampling</h3>
  The code then simply applies the given pixel-to-wavelength calibration converting each pixel value to its corresponding wavelength value.
  This results in a non-linear sampling with varying pixel size as a function of wavelength. PyNOT overcomes this by interpolating
  the spectrum onto a linearized wavelength grid resulting in a constant sampling with fixed pixel size in wavelength.
  If you want to skip this additional interpolation and keep the raw but varying pixel size, you can pass the option <code>--no-int</code>
  in the command line. 
  <br><br>

  <b>Logarithmic resampling:</b><br>
  You can also tell PyNOT to resample the spectrum onto a logarithmic grid instead of a linear grid. The number of pixels is conserved but the
  pixel size is rescaled to vary linearly with wavelength resulting in a fixed pixel size in velocity space. To do so, pass the command line option
  <code>--log</code>.
  This logarithmic resmapling can be very practical for certain scientific analyses (e.g., cross-correlations in redshift/velocity space).
  <br><br>

  <b>Increased sampling:</b><br>
  In some cases you may want to increase the wavelength sampling. This is performed by increasing the number of pixels in the output wavelength grid
  in either linear or log-space. By default, the number of detector pixels determines the native sampling, however, you can use the command line option
  <code>--npix</code> to bypass this as set a higher or lower number of pixels.

<h2>Example commands</h2>

<p>
  In order to perform a wavelength calibration of the 1D spectrum 'object_1D.fits' (must be a FITS table format) using the identified list of reference
  calibration lines 'pixeltab.dat' (from PyNOT identify), you can run:

  <pre><code>pynot wave1d object_1D.fits --table pixeltab.dat  --output object_1D_wavecal.fits</code></pre>

  which will create the wavelength calibrated 1D spectrum named 'object_1D_wavecal.fits' in this case. Note that it's mandatory to give an output filename
  with the <code>-o</code> (or <code>--output</code>) option.
  <br>
  
  If we want to set the sampling at a fixed number of 3000 pixels, then we can include the following option:

  <pre><code>pynot wave1d object_1D.fits --table pixeltab.dat  --output object_1D_wavecal.fits --npix 3000</code></pre>

  And if we instead want to resample the spectrum onto a logarithmic grid of 3000 pixels, then we include the <code>--log</code> option:

  <pre><code>pynot wave1d object_1D.fits --table pixeltab.dat  --output object_1D_wavecal.fits --npix 3000 --log</code></pre>
