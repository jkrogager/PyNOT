    <h1>PyNOT : extract</h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    This task is used to extract a 1-dimensional spectrum from the 2-dimensional detector image. 
    The default behavior of this task is to open an interactive graphical interface which will allow you
    to do the following steps:

    <ol>
      <li>Define extraction model or aperture</li>
      <li>Define sky regions</li>
      <li>Perform sky-subtraction</li>
      <li>Fit and optimize the extraction profile</li>
      <li>Extract the 1D spectrum using optimal or aperture extraction</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    The command <code>pynot extract calibrated_image.fits</code> takes the already calibrated image,
    on which the following steps have already been carried out: bias subtraction, flat-fielding,
    cosmic ray flagging, wavelength calibration, and optionally flux calibration and sky subtraction.
    The task will open the following graphical interface:

      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    There are two panels in the central main part of the window. The top one shows the science image that
    was loaded. The bottom one starts out blank and will show the fitted background model, if the user
    choses to do so. The right-hand part of the window shows the SPSF view (SPSF = Spectral point spread function)
    and the related parameters. The SPSF profile shown is calculated by summing the science image along the spectral
    direction within the x ranges defined by <i>X-min</i> and <i>X-max</i>. Regions along the slit, in the <i>y</i>
    direction, that fall outside the <i>Y-min</i> and <i>Y-max</i> will be ignored in the extraction.
    <br><br>

    The <i>SPSF model</i> determines how the spectrum is extracted. Using either a "Moffat" or "Gaussian"
    profile will fit the SPSF along the spectral direction and use this modelled profile to perform
    a weighted optimal extraction. Alternatively, the "tophat" profile can be used to perform a standard
    aperture extraction by simply summing the flux within the aperture boundaries.
    <br><br>

    <b>Adding objects along the slit:</b><br>
    The spectral trace denotes the location of the spectrum along the dispersion axis (for bright objects,
    this is visible as a striahgt or slightly curved band in the 2D View).
    The code tries to identify point sources automatically. These will be highlighted in the SPSF view
    in the upper right corner as a vertical solid line.
    The default width of the extraction aperture is shown by the dashed lines. The position of the center
    and edges of the extraction aperture can be dragged by clicking and holding each of the lines.
    <br><b>Note:</b> All extraction apertures will use the same model for the extraction: either optimal
    (using Gaussian or Moffat profiles) or aperture extraction.
    <br><br>

    If the code does not correctly identify the source (or sources) you want to extract, you can manually
    define a new extraction aperture using the <i>"Add Object"</i> button. You can then click on a position
    along the slit in the SPSF viewer and the new aperture model will show up as a vertical line.
    <br><br>

    All objects are listed in the bottom part of the right-hand panel in the <i>List of Extraction Apertues</i>.
    Right-clicking on an object in this list will bring up an option-menu which allows you to remove
    or copy the aperture, as well as changing the aperture properties.
    <br><br>

    <b>Deleting objects along the slit:</b><br>
    Similarly if an object has been incorrectly identified or added by mistake, you can click the
    <i>"Delete Object"</i> button and then click on the given aperture model you want to delete.
    <br><b>Note:</b> You can also drag an aperture to a new position instead of deleting and then adding
    a new aperture if an object is identified at the wrong location.

  <h3>Fitting the background</h3>
  <p>
    Next step is to define sky-subtraction regions. The automatic sky-subtraction algorithm
    <a href="skysub.html">pynot skysub</a>" usually does a good job but sometimes there are residual gradients
    or other features in the background which can be optimized especially if there are extended objects
    in the slit.
    <br><br>
    
    To do so, the user can select regions along the slit as background regions by clicking the button
    <i>"Select Background"</i> or by hitting the keyboard shortcut <i>"B"</i>. This will change the prompt
    in the SPSF view and instruct the user to select the left and right borders of a sky region. This can be repeated
    as many times as needed. Overlapping regions will automatically be merged.
    The selected region will show up as a light blue vertical band. Sky background ranges can be removed
    by clicking on the button <i>Delete Object</i> and then clicking on the blue band that should be removed.
    <br><br>

    The background can then be fitted using a polynomial of variable order. This is done either by clicking
    the <i>"Fit Background"</i> or using the keyboard shortcut: 

    When you have selected the sky background regions, fit the background by clicking <i>"Fit Background"</i>
    in the bottom row of the <i>main panel</i> or (cmd/control + shift + F). This will update the
    background model view in the bottom part of the main panel and will show a model in the
    'SPSF view' as a dashed blue line. The polynomial order for the background model can be changed
    by pressing the <i>"Options"</i> button on the top row (or on mac: cmd + ,) which will bring up the
    options window as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
  </p>

      Fig. 2 &ndash; An example of the options dialog of <code>pynot extract</code> allowing the user to
      change the filtering and polynomial order used for the background subtraction. The parameters
      used for the automatic object identification can also be changed.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <h3>Fitting the Spectral Trace</h3>
  <p>
    The spectral trace is fitted using a parametric model of the spatial profile in bins along the
    dispersion axis (you change this <i>Bin Size</i> below the SPSF View).
    There are 2 options for the parametric <i>SPSF model</i> which subsequently determine the profile
    for the <u>optimal extraction</u>: Moffat or Gaussian. For a <u>standard aperture extraction</u>,
    select the <i>Tophat</i> model (note that the centroid of the Tophat profile is fitted using a
    Moffat profile).<br>

    To fit the position (and width of the trace model, if Moffat or Gaussian) click the
    <i>Fit Spectral Trace</i> button (cmd + F).
    <br><br>
  
    A progress bar will then appear. If the fit is slow, try to use a narrower region of <i>Y pixels</i>
    (Y-min/Y-max) and/or exclude the ends of the X-axis where the object may be too faint,
    alternatively use a larger <i>Bin Size</i>.
    <br><br>
  
    Once the fitting is done, the program will switch to the <i>Fitting Points</i> tab shown in Figure 3.
    <figure>
      <img width="80%" src="../../images/extract2.png" alt=""/>

      <figcaption>
        Fig. 3 &ndash; An example of the graphical extraction interface of <code>pynot extract</code>
        after fitting the spectral trace model. In this case, a <i>Moffat</i> profile has been fitted
        along the spectral trace. The panels in this window show the fitted parameters of the model
        as a function of the wavelength or pixels along the dispersion axis.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    Here the parameters of the fitted spectral trace are shown:
    the centroid and width parameters (if Moffat or Gaussian).
    The points indicate the fitted positions of the spatial profile.
    The dashed lines mark the polynomial representation as a function of wavelength
    (or dispersion axis, if no wavelength solution has been applied).
    The order of the polynomial used to fit the points is given as the <i>Polynomial Orders</i>
    on the right. One order for the centroid and one for the width parameters
    (for the Moffat profile, both parameters alpha and beta are fitted using the same order).
    <br><br>


    <b>Manipulating Fitting Points:</b><br>
    The fitted points (solid circles) often contain outliers where the profile fit failed.
    These outliers can be removed by clicking on the given point, which will change the appearance
    to transparent with a black cross over it. An excluded point can be included again by clicking
    on it. You can also perform a median filtering by changing the <i>Filter Width</i> and the
    significance threshold <i>Kappa</i> and then clicking the <i>Median Filter Points</i> button.<br>
    The gray shaded regions mark the X-min and X-max limits defined in the right-hand panel.
    Points in these shaded regions are excluded in the polynomial fit along the dispersion axis.
    If several objects are defined you can toggle them visible/invisible by clicking on the given
    tick-mark in the List of Extraction Apertures.
    <br><br>
  
    When you are happy with the trace model (dashed lines) along the dispersion axis,
    you can verify the given profile in the <i>2D View</i>, which is shown in Figure 4.
    The given spectral trace will be over-plotted on the top panel
    (if toggled visible in the List of Apertures).
    The points shown in the 2D View can also be used to remove outlier points. 
    This will deactivate all parameters (centroid and widths) of the given point 
    (they can be re-activated under the tab Fitting Points).

        on the science image. The points indicate the fitting points from the figure before. These can
        be deselected in this view by clicking on them, see text for details.

    <h3>Extracting the 1D Spectrum</h3>

    When the model of the spectral trace has been defined, you are ready to extract the given aperture
    by clicking the <i>"Extract 1D Spectrum"</i> button in the middle of the top row (cmd + E).
    The program will change to the <i>"1D View"</i> tab where the extracted spectrum
    (or spectra, if several objects are defined) is shown, see Figure 5.
    The units on the X-axis (dispersion) are pixels by default, if no wavelength solution has been applied.
    If a wavelength solution is present, the proper units will be shown. 
    Similar for the flux on the Y-axis, the default units are counts unless other units are 
    present in the header of the input FITS file. The FITS Header can be shown by going to the menu:
    'View > Display Header'.

      after extracting the 1D spectrum. Here the extracted flux is shown as a function of wavelength
      or pixels along the dispersion axis, if the data have not been wavelength calibrated.
      If more than one spectral aperture is defined, all spectra will be shown unless they are de-selected
      in the <i>List of Extraction Apertures</i> by clicking the tick-box.

  <b>Saving the Output:</b><br>
  When you have successfully extracted the 1D spectrum and verified that it looks as expected,
  you can save the 1D extraction by pressing the button <i>Done</i> on the top row.
  This will promt you to save the spectrum in various formats: FITS, FITS Table or ASCII
  (a short example of the format is shown). If several objects are defined, you can save
  them all as individual extensions of a FITS Table by pressing <i>Save All</i>.
  <br><br>

  You can also save individual spectra by right-clicking on the given aperture model in the 
  <i>List of Extraction Apertures</i>. This also allows you to save the extraction model profile.
  You can also save the sky-subtracted 2D spectrum and the sky model by using the <i>File</i> menu.
