  <h1>PyNOT : skysub</h1>
</header>

<p>
  This task takes a 2-dimensional image as input and performs a background subtraction using an automated object
  detection and masking. The background level is then fitted by a polynomial of variable degree excluding pixels
  flagged as objects (i.e., significantly above the noise level) or artefacts such as cosmic rays.
  The task performs the following sub-tasks:

  <ol class="subtasklist">
    <li><a href="#detection">Object detection</a></li>
    <li><a href="#fitting">Polynomial fitting of rows (wavelength bins)</a></li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h2 id="detection">Object detection</h2>
<p>
  The object detection is performed by first collapsing the data array along the dispersion axis to obtain the
  spatial profile along the slit. If the dispersion axis is incorrectly identified from the file itself
  you can set it using the <code>--axis</code> option. Next, the noise level is determined based on the median
  absolute deviation (MAD) of the data themselves. Objects are then identified as peaks in the spatial profile
  above a certain threshold defined as \( \kappa_{\rm obj} \times {\rm MAD} \) using <code>scipy.signal.find_peaks</code>.
  The threshold factor is set to 20 by default but can be changed by the <code>--obj_kappa</code> option.
  Additionally, a peak must extend over at least 3 pixels to be considered a real object. The width of each peak
  estimated and used to mask out pixels around the centroid: \( x_{\rm cen} \pm s \times {\rm width} \), where <i>s</i>
  is a user-defined scale-factor (by default set to 3). The scale-factor can be changed by the <code>--fwhm_scale</code>
  option. The object detection algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 1.

<p class="note">
  Note: This algorithm has been optimized for point sources or objects which have significant amount of empty background
  within the slit. Very extended objects may require a different strategy, such as <i>"Nodding along the slit"</i> or
  <i>"Offset sky observations"</i>. PyNOT does not currently handle such strategies. You can also use the interactive tool
  <a href="extract.html">pynot extract</a> to determine a background model, subtract it and save the result.
</p>


<h2 id="fitting">Polynomial fitting of rows (wavelength bins)</h2>
<p>
  Once any objects have been identified, the code loops through all the rows of the data array, that is, each wavelength bin
  along the dispersion axis is fitted idenpendently. It is therefore recommended to apply a 2D rectification of the dispersion
  axis along the slit using <a href="wave2d.html">pynot wave2d</a>. This ensures that skylines are straightened out.
  Any residual "curvature" of the sky-lines may lead to residuals in the sky-subtracted image.
  <br>
  Each row is filtered using a median filter in order to clip artefacts, such as cosmic ray hits or bad pixels. 
  The noise-level per row is determined using the MAD, and outlying pixels are flagged if they are more than 
  \( \kappa \times {\rm MAD} \) above or below the median filtered row. The options of the median-filtering and sigma-clipping
  are controlled by the options <code>--med_kernel</code> and <code>--kappa</code>, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>

  Lastly, the pixels that are not flagged as objects, outliers and fall within the <code>--xmin</code> and <code>--xmax</code> values
  are used to fit a Chebyshev polynomial of variable degree, controlled by the option <code>--order_bg</code>. By default
  a 3<sup>rd</sup> order polynomial is used. The x<sub>min</sub> and x<sub>max</sub> values are used to exclude any artefacts at the edge
  of the data array (CCD artefacts, vignetting, etc).
  An example of the fitting algorithm is shown in Fig. 2.

The output is saved as a FITS file with an added extension named <i>"SKY"</i> which holds the 2D background model
subtracted from the science image.
